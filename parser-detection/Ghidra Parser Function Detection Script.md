# Ghidra Parser Function Detection Script

## Overview

This comprehensive Python script automates the identification of message and file parsing functions within loaded binaries in Ghidra. It is specifically designed for analyzing large C++ binaries where virtual calls and complex class structures make manual analysis challenging and time-consuming.

The script employs sophisticated pattern-based analysis techniques to detect functions that are likely involved in data parsing operations, including protocol handlers, file format parsers, message decoders, and data serialization/deserialization routines.

## Features

### Core Detection Capabilities

**String Signature Analysis**: The script searches for strings commonly associated with parsing operations such as "parse," "decode," "unpack," "deserialize," "read," "header," "magic," "version," and many others. It then analyzes cross-references to these strings to locate the functions that utilize them, providing strong indicators of parsing functionality.

**Loop Pattern Detection**: Identifies functions containing iterative constructs that repeatedly process small chunks of data from buffers. This includes detection of while loops, for loops, and other repetitive patterns that increment pointers or indices within parsing contexts.

**Sequential Field Access Analysis**: Detects code patterns that sequentially access fields of structures or classes from base pointers, such as accessing offsets like ptr+0x4, ptr+0x8, ptr+0xc, which are characteristic of structured data parsing.

**Library Function Call Analysis**: Flags functions that invoke common I/O or memory manipulation functions including memcpy, memmove, read, recv, sscanf, and other functions typically used in data processing operations.

### Advanced Pattern Recognition

**State Machine Detection**: Identifies switch statement patterns and state transition logic commonly found in protocol parsers and complex data format handlers.

**Buffer Bounds Checking**: Analyzes functions for security-conscious programming patterns including length validations, size comparisons, and overflow protection mechanisms.

**Endianness Handling**: Detects byte order conversion patterns including calls to network byte order functions (ntohl, ntohs, htonl, htons) and manual byte swapping operations.

### Output and Annotation Features

**Comprehensive Scoring System**: Each detected function receives a confidence score based on multiple weighted criteria, allowing users to prioritize their analysis efforts on the most promising candidates.

**Automatic Annotation**: The script adds predefined comments to function entry points in the disassembly view, providing immediate context about why each function was flagged as a potential parser.

**Bookmark Integration**: Creates bookmarks for easy navigation to detected functions, integrating seamlessly with Ghidra's bookmark management system.

**Multiple Report Formats**: Generates detailed console output, CSV reports for spreadsheet analysis, and HTML reports with interactive features for comprehensive documentation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

This script requires Ghidra 10.x or later with Python scripting support enabled. The script is designed to work with Ghidra's built-in Jython 2.7 interpreter and does not require additional Python packages beyond those included with Ghidra.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Script**: Save the `ghidra_parser_detector.py` file to your Ghidra scripts directory. The default location is typically:
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\ghidra_scripts`
   - Linux/macOS: `~/ghidra_scripts`

2. **Verify Script Location**: Open Ghidra and navigate to Window → Script Manager. The script should appear in the list of available scripts. If it doesn't appear, check that the file is in the correct directory and refresh the script manager.

3. **Load Target Binary**: Open the binary you want to analyze in Ghidra. Ensure that the binary has been properly analyzed using Ghidra's auto-analysis features, as the script relies on function identification and symbol resolution.

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage

To run the script with default settings:

1. Open your target binary in Ghidra
2. Navigate to Window → Script Manager
3. Locate "ghidra_parser_detector.py" in the script list
4. Double-click the script or select it and click "Run"
5. Monitor the console output for progress updates
6. Review results in the console and navigate to bookmarked functions

### Configuration Options

The script provides several configuration options through the `ParserDetectorConfig` class:

**Custom Keywords**: Add domain-specific parsing keywords by modifying the `get_custom_keywords()` method. For example, if analyzing a specific protocol, you might add keywords like "packet_header", "frame_decode", or "protocol_parse".

**Custom I/O Functions**: Extend the list of I/O functions to include application-specific or library-specific functions by modifying the `get_custom_io_functions()` method.

**Score Thresholds**: Adjust the minimum score threshold and confidence level boundaries by modifying the respective methods in the configuration class. Lower thresholds will detect more functions but may increase false positives.

### Advanced Usage Modes

**Enhanced Analysis**: Use the `run_enhanced_analysis()` function for more comprehensive detection including state machine patterns, bounds checking analysis, and endianness handling detection.

**Quick Scan**: Use the `quick_scan()` function for faster analysis with lower thresholds, suitable for initial reconnaissance of large binaries.

**Focused Analysis**: Use the `focused_scan(pattern)` function to analyze only functions matching a specific name pattern, useful when you have some knowledge of the target binary's naming conventions.

## Understanding the Results

### Confidence Levels

**HIGH Confidence (Score ≥ 70)**: Functions with high confidence scores exhibit multiple strong indicators of parsing functionality. These should be prioritized for manual analysis as they are very likely to be genuine parser functions.

**MEDIUM Confidence (Score 40-69)**: Functions with moderate confidence scores show several parsing indicators but may lack some key characteristics. These warrant investigation but may include some utility functions or data processing routines that aren't strictly parsers.

**LOW Confidence (Score 20-39)**: Functions with low confidence scores show some parsing-related patterns but may be false positives. These should be reviewed with skepticism and may include general data manipulation functions.

**VERY LOW Confidence (Score < 20)**: Functions below the default threshold are not reported unless the threshold is manually lowered. These are likely false positives or very weak candidates.

### Scoring Criteria

The scoring system evaluates multiple factors:

- **String References (0-30 points)**: Functions referencing parsing-related strings receive higher scores, with points awarded based on the number and relevance of string references.

- **Loop Constructs (0-25 points)**: Functions containing loops, especially those with increment operations and memory access patterns, receive additional points.

- **Field Access Patterns (0-20 points)**: Sequential field access patterns and multiple structure offset accesses contribute to the score.

- **I/O Function Calls (0-25 points)**: Calls to memory manipulation and I/O functions increase the score based on the number and type of functions called.

- **Function Name Analysis (0-10 points)**: Functions with names containing parsing-related keywords receive bonus points.

- **Function Size Consideration (0-5 points)**: Functions of appropriate size (50-500 instructions) receive a small bonus, as very small or very large functions are less likely to be dedicated parsers.

## Customization Guide

### Adding Custom Detection Patterns

To add custom detection patterns for specific domains or applications:

1. **Extend Keyword Lists**: Modify the `PARSING_KEYWORDS` and `IO_FUNCTIONS` lists in the `ParserDetector` class constructor to include domain-specific terms.

2. **Implement Custom Analyzers**: Create new analysis methods following the pattern of existing analyzers like `analyze_function_for_loops()` or `analyze_field_access_patterns()`.

3. **Adjust Scoring Logic**: Modify the `calculate_parser_score()` method to incorporate new analysis results into the scoring system.

### Modifying Output Formats

The script supports multiple output formats that can be customized:

**Console Output**: Modify the `print_results()` method to change the format of console output, add additional information, or change the grouping of results.

**CSV Reports**: Customize the `generate_csv_report()` method to include additional fields or modify the structure of the CSV output.

**HTML Reports**: Enhance the `generate_html_report()` method to add interactive features, styling changes, or additional visualizations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Script Not Appearing in Script Manager**: Ensure the script file is saved in the correct Ghidra scripts directory and that the file has the correct `.py` extension. Refresh the script manager if necessary.

**Analysis Taking Too Long**: For very large binaries, consider using the quick scan mode or focused analysis on specific function name patterns. You can also increase the minimum score threshold to reduce the number of functions analyzed.

**No Functions Detected**: This may indicate that the binary doesn't contain obvious parsing functions, or that the detection patterns need to be customized for the specific binary type. Try lowering the score threshold or adding custom keywords relevant to your analysis target.

**Memory Issues**: For extremely large binaries, the script may consume significant memory. Consider analyzing smaller sections of the binary or increasing Ghidra's memory allocation.

### Performance Optimization

**Selective Analysis**: Use the focused scan feature to analyze only functions matching specific patterns when you have prior knowledge about the binary structure.

**Threshold Tuning**: Adjust the minimum score threshold to balance between detection completeness and analysis speed.

**Parallel Processing**: For advanced users, the script can be modified to process functions in parallel, though this requires careful handling of Ghidra's API thread safety.
